	// The storeURL property applies only to disk based stores and will be nil for in-

	// the URL representation of the filepath string.

@property (readonly) BOOL didCreateStore;

	// The didCreateStore property only applies to disk based stores and will be YES if 
	// SearchKit created a store at the file URL specified during store creation, NO 
	// otherwise. You can check this value when you initialize a file based store from a
	// saved URL to see if the file still existed. If not, you might use the opportunity
	// to rebuild the search index.

@property (readwrite) BOOL usesSpotlightImporters;

	// This calls the SKLoadDefaultExtractorPlugIns search kit method. You should only
	// call this accessor once and prior to loading any file based data into your store.
	
@property (readwrite) BOOL usesConcurrentIndexing;

	// Indexing will occur on a thread separate from the main thread. Only one item will
	// be added to the search index at a time, but batch document indexing will not
	// stall the UI during processing.
	
@property (readwrite) BOOL ignoresNumericTerms;
	
	// SearchKit text analysis options include support for a kSKTermChars and kSKStartTermChars
	// value, but they are used to specify valid word characters in addition to the default
	// alphanumeric characters. If you want to ignore numeric "words" in your results,
	// set this value to YES. Numeric words are still indexed, but they will not be included
	// in term (and search?) results.

	// SearchKit allows you specify the maximum amount of time or the maximum number of results 
	// an individual SKSearchFindMatches / fetch operation should take or return. You may set these
	// values to suit your needs. The default fetchTime is 0.5 seconds and the default fetchCount 
	// is 100. This does not place an upper limit on the total number of results which will be
	// returned, only a limit on the results captured in any one chunk. Refer to the fetchResults:

	// See the SearchKit documentation for a complete listing of the analysis options.
	
	// If you do not call this method prior to creating a search store, a bare set of default

	// Stop words are short, common words such as articles, prepositions and conjunctions

	// SearchKit does not include built-in sets of stop words, so this class attempts
	// to provide default values. You must specify the default stop words and other 
	// analysis preferences prior to the creation of your index using the method above.
	
	// inLanguage is a two-character language specifier such as "en" or "de". Currently
	// this method only returns stop words for the English language. You may expand 
	// stop word support by modifying the SPSearchStoreStopWords() function in the class
	// file.

#pragma mark Index / Document Management

- (BOOL) addDocument:(NSURL*)inFileURL typeHint:(NSString*)inMimeHint;
- (BOOL) addDocument:(NSURL*)inDocumentURI withText:(NSString*)inContents;

	// These two methods form the core of document indexing. You can index two kinds of content:
	// 1. file based content and 2. free-standing text content.
	
	// When you index file based content you must provide the url of the local file. You may
	// also provide a mime type hint which can help SearchKit determine which text importer
	// to use when indexing the file. inMimeHint may be nil.
	
	// When you index free-standing text you must provide some kind of resource identifier
	// which tells SearchKit how to refer to that content. For example, if you maintain a core 
	// data store, you can use a custom uri format to refer to your objects in a persistent 
	// manner, such as myapp://entry/xid, where xid is an attribute by which you can re-fetch 
	// that entry object.
	
	// Returns YES if the document was successfully indexed, no otherwise; however, the return
	// value is always YES if you have set usesConcurrentIndexing.

- (BOOL) removeDocument:(NSURL*)inDocumentURI;

	// Use a single method to remove a document from the search index. If it is a file, simply
	// pass the same file URL you provided to the addDocument method. If it is free-standing
	// text content, use the same document URI previously used.
	
	// Returns YES if the document was successfully removed, no otherwise; however, the return
	// value is always YES if you have set usesConcurrentIndexing.
	
- (BOOL) replaceDocument:(NSURL*)oldDocumentURL withDocument:(NSURL*)newDocumentURL typeHint:(NSString*)inMimeHint;
- (BOOL) replaceDocument:(NSURL*)oldDocumentURI withDocument:(NSURL*)newDocumentURI withText:(NSString*)inContents;

	// These are convenience methods for updating the search index when either 1. a document's 
	// file url has changed or 2. the content uri has changed. Normally you can simply add a 
	// changed document to the index, and the old indexing is replaced. When the document's uri
	// changes, however, you must remove it from the store first, providing the old location, or
	// else you will end up with orphaned content.
	
	// More succinctly: use these methods when a document's location changes.

- (void) setProperties:(NSDictionary*)inProperties forDocument:(NSURL*)inDocumentURI;
- (NSDictionary*) propertiesForDocument:(NSURL*)inDocumentURI;

	// SearchKit supports the association of arbitrary key-value pairs with the documents it keeps
	// in an index. Use these methods to store and retrieve document specific metadata with
	// the index. You may pass file or custom urls to inDocumentURI. 

- (BOOL) setName:(NSString*)inTitle forDocument:(NSURL*)inDocumentURI;
- (NSString*) nameOfDocument:(NSURL*)inDocumentURI;

	// Changes the name of a file based or free standing text document. Return YES if the operation
	// was successful.
	
	// Returns the name of a file based or free standing text document. Returns nil if there is no
	// name or if the operation is not successful.

- (SKDocumentIndexState) stateOfDocument:(NSURL*)inDocumentURI;

	// Docs: "A document URL object (SKDocumentRef) can be in one of four states, as defined by the 
	// SKDocumentIndexState enumeration: not indexed, indexed, not in the index but will be added 
	// after the index is flushed or closed, and in the index but will be deleted after the index is 
	// flushed or closed."

- (NSArray*) allDocuments:(BOOL)ignoreEmptyDocuments;

	// Returns all the documents currently indexed in the search store. If ignoreEmptyDocuments is YES,
	// documents with a term count of zero will not be returned, so that the count may not match a 
	// separate call to SKIndexGetDocumentCount().
	
	// When ignoreEmptyDocuments is YES, this method may not return every document you have added to 
	// the store. When ignoreEmptyDocuments is NO, this method may return "documents" which you have 
	// not explicitly added to the store. See the implementation for details on native SearchKit 
	// behavior and why this method may return unexpected results.
	
	// Generally you should maintain a separate account of the documents you add to a store and set
	// ignoreEmptyDocuments to YES, or not use this method at all.
	
#pragma mark -

- (BOOL) compactStore:(float)tolerance;

	// Over time an index becomes bloated with orphaned terms whose associated documents have been
	// removed but which are themselves left behind. Compacting an index removes these orphaned terms.
	// You should call this method from time to time. One option is to call it anytime you initialize 
	// a previously saved store. SPSearchStore will check for bloat and compact the index if necessary, 
	// taking into account the tolerance value you specify. Returns YES when compacting is required.
	
	// tolerance should be between 0 and 1. Pass a value of 0 to force this method to compact the index.
	
	// Because index compacting is potentially an expensive operation, SPSearchStore always performs
	// the operation on a separate thread. Indexing and querying are unavailable during this time, and
	// any calls to index or query the store will block that thread until compaction is completed.

- (BOOL) saveChangesToStore;
	
	// This updates the index store backing. For an in-memory store it updates the storeData object
	// and for on-disk stores is writes out the index to the filesystem. SPSearchStore manages the
	// store state as needed by your search and term requests, but you may save the store at any
	// time by calling this method.
	
- (BOOL) closeStore;

	// Cancels any active search and closes access to the index. This method does not update the store
	// backing. Call saveChangesToStore if you also want to save changes to the search index.
	
	// You will usually want to call this method immediately prior to your application shutting down
	// or the closing of a document. You should call this method in both managed and garbage 
	// collecting environments.

#pragma mark Searching

- (void) prepareSearch:(NSString*)searchQuery options:(SKSearchOptions)searchOptions;
- (BOOL) fetchResults:(NSArray**)outDocuments ranks:(float**)outRanks untilFinished:(BOOL)untilComplete;
- (BOOL) fetchResults:(NSArray**)outDocuments ranksArray:(NSArray**)outRanks untilFinished:(BOOL)untilComplete;
	
	// SearchKit uses a two stage pattern to perform searching, and that process is mirrored by this
	// class. The first stage initializes the search from a query / options combination and starts the 
	// search running on a separate thread. The second stage consists of potentially multiple calls to 
	// the index asking for chunks of the search results.
	
	// Use these two methods to perform a search. First prepare the search using a query string and 
	// search options, then submit mutliple calls to fetchResults. That method will return YES until the 
	// search query is exhausted, at which point it will return NO and clean up the operation. You may
	// cancel the query at any prior point using the cancelSearch method below.
	
	// If you would prefer to make a single call to fetchResults you may set the untilComplete flag to
	// YES. If you perform this method on its own separate thread in order to prevent blocking of the
	// UI, you should call cancelSearch before preparing another query, for example, if the user changes 
	// the query string before the current search returns.
	
	// outRanks should be a pointer to an array of float values, or NULL. Because the size of the array
	// is not determined beforehand, the memory will be allocated and returned to the caller. You must
	// call free() on the value to release the memory. outDocuments is an autoreleased NSArray. The
	// number of floats in outRanks is equal to the count of outDocuments.
	
	// If you do not want to bother with the managing of C float pointers you may use the second of the
	// fetchResults functions which takes an NSArray paramater for the outRanks value. This is a 
	// convenience method that is otherwise functionally the same. It will, however, be slower, due to 
	// the objective-c runtime overhead necessary to wrap float values in NSNumber objects. The impact
	// may or may not be negligible depending on your needs. You should still normalize the final
	// relevance scores using the appropriate method below.
	
	
	// SearchKit is extremely flexible and quite powerful with regards to query processing and search 
	// options. It supports phrasal, prefix, suffix and boolean searching. Documentation describes the
	// syntax as "Google-like".
	
	// Often, however, it will not be enough to simply pass a user generated string directly to 
	// SearchKit. Cocoa developers accustomed to the simplicity of predicate syntax such as 
	// contains[cd] will wonder why SearchKit doesn't provide this kind of searching directly.
	
	// While diacrtical and case sensitive issues are automatically handled, SearchKit otherwise 
	// looks for exact matches unless you surround your strings with the wildcard character. For 
	// example, predicate syntax such as "contains[cd] tune" must look like "*tune*" to SearchKit. If
	// your user expects this kind of functionality but doesn't know or shouldn't have to correctly 
	// format the string, it will be up to you to make the necessary adjustments.
	
	// See the "How Search Kit Performs Searches" subsection in the SearchKit documentation for more 
	// info on sytnax.
	
- (float*) copyNormalizedRankings:(float*)inRankings;
- (NSArray*) normalizedRankingsArray:(NSArray*)inRankings;

	// Although search kit does support relevance searching, the results are not normalized and may cover
	// an enormous range. This is a convenience method that converts the results to a value between 0 and 1
	// in proportion to the largest rank. The method returns the rankings in the same order it received them.
	// Usually you will call this method after fetchResults has completed.
	
	// You are responsible for the memory created and returned by copyNormalizedRankings. You should release 
	// it using free(). If you use normazliedRankingsArray the memory is already autoreleased.

- (BOOL) isStillSearching;
- (void) cancelSearch;

	// Use these methods to check the status of the index and to cancel any current searches. Normally
	// you won't need to check if a search is continuing, as multiple calls to fetchResults:ranks: will
	// exhaust the search results. But you may want to cancel a search prematurely, if, for example,
	// the user changes the query. It is always safe to call cancelSearch even when no search is currely
	// taking place.

#pragma mark -
#pragma mark Document Terms

	// The following methods may be used to establish a lexicon or glossary. They provide access to
	// the two-way term <-> document associations in the index and can be used to get all the terms
	// in the index, all the terms in a document, all the documents associated with a term, and the
	// number of times a term appears in the index or in a document. Yeah, it's awesome.
	
	// The following methods refer to documentURIs instead of fileURLs, but it does not matter what
	// kind of URL object you are passing to them. Term management does not distinguish between
	// file based or free-standing text content. I have defaulted to URI because it is a more
	// general acronym.

- (NSArray*) allTerms;
	
	// Returns all the terms used in your the search store. You must have specified 
	// kSKIndexInvertedVector when creating the store, as is the case for all of the following 
	// document <-> term methods.

- (NSUInteger) documentCountForTerm:(NSString*)inTerm;

	// Returns the total number of documents associated with a term. This is a relatively fast
	// method and can be used to provide a document count for a given term without actually
	// retrieving the documents.
	
- (NSArray*) documentsForTerm:(NSString*)inTerm;

	// Returns an array of URLs / URIs identifying the documents which contain the specified term.
	// This is the good stuff right here, allowing you to discover relationships between data sets
	// depending on the document content. This kind of capability could form the basis of a much
	// more comprehensive semantic engine.
	
- (NSUInteger) termCountForDocument:(NSURL*)inDocumentURI;

	// Returns the total number of distinct terms associated with a document. This is a relatively
	// fast method and can be used to provide a term count for a document without actually
	// retrieving the document's terms.
	
- (NSArray*) termsForDocument:(NSURL*)inDocumentURI;
	
	// Retrurns an array of NSString objects identifying the terms contained within a document.
	// This is the other good stuff, allowing you to extract a list of unique words contained
	// within a document. You can then call documentsForTerm: to get every other document in the
	// index which contains a term in this array.
	
- (NSUInteger) frequencyOfTerm:(NSString*)inTerm inDocument:(NSURL*)inDocumentURI;

	// Returns the total number of times a specific term occurs in a document.
